# HTML5 and CSS3 - Learning from DIO

The content of this repository are codes to learn HTML5 and CSS3.
The lectures were all taught on the digital and free platform [DIO](https://web.digitalinnovation.one).

I've separated the classes into the way the content was shown.

- **Class01**: Super introductory, we knew about the base elements and declarations;
- **Class02**: We could know more about another elements and Headings;
- **Class03**: We learned about _href_ Attribute;
- **Class04**: Adding image, know about _src_ and _alt_ Attribute;
- **Class05**: Added a list with external references and had to alter the src from the photo on index to always refer to folder inside the Class04 (to made this repo a little mor light, _used the "../" as it was a bash command, did not knew that was possible_);
- **Class06/CSS3 00**: we messed a little with background color, font sizes and create a couple classes and made a id to title;
- **Class07/CSS3 01**: We were introduced to the concept of _Margin_, _Border_, _Paddings_ and the _Content_; We changed the _Border radius_ and it style;
- **Class08/CSS3 02**: Now we can manage to change font _style_, _family_ and _color_;
- **Class09/CSS3 03**: We learned how to customized list;
- **Class10/CSS3 04**:The last one we learned about how to scale better the images and we were learned how to center align text, _I did manage to discover how to center align photo via w3schools._
- **Intro-Bootstrap**:In a new class I had a glimpse of what is to work with Bootstrap and made a simple single page responsive site.
